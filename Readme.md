# SatTrack 
I made this Satellite tracker using the ephem module in python.

It uses TLE data from NORAD (https://celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/stations.txt) to get the co-ordinates of satellites


## Modules I used
You can download them with 
pip install -r r.txt
I used 3 modules in the code
- Ephem
- Requests
- Pyperclip

Thank you and stay safe, John
